# Xcodeproj

Xcodeproj lets you create and modify Xcode projects from [MacRuby][macruby].
Script boring management tasks or build Xcode-friendly libraries. Also includes
support for Xcode workspaces (.xcworkspace) and configuration files (.xcconfig).

It is used in [CocoaPods](https://github.com/cocoapods/cocoapods) to create a
static library from scratch, for both iOS and OSX.


## Installing Xcodeproj

Youâ€™ll need MacRuby. xcodeproj itself installs through RubyGems, the Ruby
package manager. Download and install [version 0.10][macruby-dl] and then
perform the following command:

    $ sudo macgem install xcodeproj

The load time can be improved a bit by compiling the Ruby source files:

    $ sudo macgem install rubygems-compile
    $ sudo macgem compile xcodeproj


## Colaborate

All Xcodeproj development happens on [GitHub][xcodeproj]. Contributing patches
is really easy and gratifying. You even get push access when one of your patches
is accepted.

Follow [@CocoaPodsOrg][twitter] to get up to date information about what's
going on in the CocoaPods world.

If you're really oldschool and you want to discuss Xcodeproj development you
can join #cocoapods on irc.freenode.net.
